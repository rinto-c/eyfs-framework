              <p>Children’s back-and-forth interactions from an early age form the foundations for language and cognitive development.</p>
              <p>The number and quality of the conversations they have with adults and peers throughout the day in a language-rich environment is crucial.</p>
              <p>By commenting on what children are interested in or doing, and echoing back what they say with new vocabulary added, practitioners will build children's language effectively.</p>
              <p>Reading frequently to children, and engaging them actively in stories, non-fiction, rhymes and poems, and then providing them with extensive opportunities to use and embed new words in a range of contexts, will give children the opportunity to thrive.</p>
              <p>Through conversation, story-telling and role play, where children share their ideas with support and modelling from their teacher, and sensitive questioning that invites them to elaborate, children become comfortable using a rich range of vocabulary and language structures</p>
