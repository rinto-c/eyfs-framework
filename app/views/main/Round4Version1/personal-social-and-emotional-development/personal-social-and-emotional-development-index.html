        <p class="govuk-body">
            Childrenâ€™s personal, social and emotional development (PSED) is crucial for children to lead healthy and happy lives, and is fundamental to their cognitive development. </p>

              <p>Underpinning their personal development are the important attachments that shape their social world.</p>

              <p>Strong, warm and supportive relationships with adults enable children to learn how to understand their own feelings and those of others.</p>

              <p>Children should be supported to manage emotions, develop a positive sense of self, set themselves simple goals, have confidence in their own abilities, to persist and wait for what they want and direct attention as necessary.</p>

              <p>Through adult modelling and guidance, they will learn how to look after their bodies, including healthy eating, and manage personal needs independently.</p>

              <p>Through supported interaction with other children they learn how to make good friendships, co-operate and resolve conflicts peaceably.</p>

              <p>These attributes will provide a secure platform from which children can achieve at school and in later life.</p>
