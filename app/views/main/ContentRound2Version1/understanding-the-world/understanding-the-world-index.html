          <p>The frequency and range of children’s personal experiences increases their knowledge and sense of the world around them – from visiting parks, libraries and museums to meeting important members of society such as police officers, nurses and firefighters.</p>
          <p>In addition, listening to a broad selection of stories, non-fiction, rhymes and poems will foster their understanding of our culturally, socially, technologically and ecologically diverse world.</p>
          <p>As well as building important knowledge, this extends their familiarity with words that support understanding across domains.</p>
          <p>Enriching and widening children’s vocabulary will support later reading comprehension.</p>
