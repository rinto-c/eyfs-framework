        Why counting is important
    </h2>

    <p>It is an often overlooked fact that we all, whether children or adults, are constantly using and applying mathematics in our everyday lives.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        What the EYFS framework says
    </h2>

    <p>Children should be able to count confidently, develop a deep understanding of the numbers to 10, the relationships between them and the patterns within those numbers.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        What this means in practice
    </h2>

    <p>One of the key methods children use to learn is trial and error; therefore, using a hands-on approach, and allowing them to experiment, is a good way for children to develop their mathematical thinking skills.</p>

    <p>Here we’ve suggested just a few examples of the toys and activities you can provide to encourage development in some of the areas of numeracy, for early years.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        How counting is linked to other areas of the EYFS
    </h2>

    <p>If leaders, staff and parents can help to equip young children with a ‘can do’ attitude around maths, giving them the confidence to try things out and discover new skills in the same way they do for other areas of learning, we will have made a massive step in the right direction.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        What other nurseries and childminders are doing
    </h2>

    <p>Caroline is Deputy Manager at a nursery in East Midlands.</p>

    <p>Caroline adapted the provision and made space for the new counting collections to be put into place within the pre-school area. She introduced one counting collection to a small group of children through an adult-led activity each week for a period of six weeks then adapted it to one counting collection per child following the child’s lead and closely worked with the children with this encouraging different ways of sorting
    and organising the collections they were counting.
    </p>

    <p>The children are now offered a counting collection in a different area of pre-school each week and this is added onto the weekly planning, the children choose an individual collection and decide what the objects will be counted into (cups, bowls, frames, bags) and how they will record the amount, this has had a positive impact and increased the social working between the children and a great way to group items to get an altogether total and increase the child’s unitary counting.
