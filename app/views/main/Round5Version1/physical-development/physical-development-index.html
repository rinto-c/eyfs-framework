          <p>Gross and fine motor experiences develop incrementally throughout early childhood, starting with sensory explorations and the development of a child’s strength, co-ordination and positional awareness through tummy time, crawling and play movement with both objects and adults.</p>

          <p>By creating games and providing opportunities for play both indoors and outdoors, adults can support children to develop their core strength, stability, balance, spatial awareness, co-ordination and agility.</p>

          <p>Gross motor skills provide the foundation for developing healthy bodies and social and emotional well-being.</p>

          <p>Fine motor control and precision helps with hand-eye co-ordination which is later linked to early literacy.</p>

          <p>Repeated and varied opportunities to explore and play with small world activities, puzzles, arts and crafts and the practise of using small tools, with feedback and support from adults, allow children to develop proficiency, control and confidence.</p>
