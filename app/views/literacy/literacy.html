    Patterns

    </h1>

    <p>Patterns are best practice design solutions for specific user-focused tasks and page&nbsp;types.</p>
    <p>All of the patterns in this section are supported by written guidance and contain coded examples where possible.</p>
    <p>Patterns often use one or more <a href="../components">components</a> and explain how to adapt them to the&nbsp;context.</p>
